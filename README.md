### Description
Learn how to perform statistics with Python.


### Level 1

- Exercise 1: 
  - Grab a sports theme dataset you like and select an attribute from the dataset. Calculate the mode, median, standard deviation, and arithmetic mean.

- Exercise 2: 
  - Continuing with the sports topic data, select two attributes and calculate their correlation.
  
### Level 2

- Exercise 3: 
  - Continuing with the sports theme data, calculate the correlation of all attributes with each other and represent them in a matrix with different colors of intensity.

### Level 3

- Exercise 4: 
  - Continuing with the sports theme data, select an attribute and calculate the geometric mean and harmonic mean.


### Targets

- Calculate different data statistics
- Graph different statistics of the data
